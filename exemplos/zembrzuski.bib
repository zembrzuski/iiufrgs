  abstract = {With the help of various positioning tools, individuals’ mobility behaviors are being continuously captured from mobile phones, wireless networking devices and GPS appliances. These mobility data serve as an important foundation for understanding individuals’ mobility behaviors. For instance, recent studies show that, despite the dissimilarity in the mobility areas covered by individuals, there is high regularity in the human mobility behaviors, suggesting that most individuals follow a simple and reproducible pattern. This survey paper reviews relevant results on uncovering mobility patterns from GPS datasets. Specially, it covers the results about inferring locations of significance for prediction of future moves, detecting modes of transport, mining trajectory patterns and recognizing location-based activities. The survey provides a general perspective for studies on the issues of individuals’ mobility by reviewing the methods and algorithms in detail and comparing the existing results on the same issues. Several new and emergent issues concerning individuals’ mobility are proposed for further research.},

@article{song2010limits,
  abstract = {A range of applications, from predicting the spread of human and electronic viruses to city planning and resource management in mobile communications, depend on our ability to foresee the whereabouts and mobility of individuals, raising a fundamental question: To what degree is human behavior predictable? Here we explore the limits of predictability in human dynamics by studying the mobility patterns of anonymized mobile phone users. By measuring the entropy of each individual's trajectory, we find a 93% potential predictability in user mobility across the whole user base. Despite the significant differences in the travel patterns, we find a remarkable lack of variability in predictability, which is largely independent of the distance users cover on a regular basis.
